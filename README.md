# Data-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes a dataset of 1000 popular IMDb movies released between 2006 and 2016. Using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, I cleaned the data, handled missing values, and checked for duplicates.

I explored different aspects such as movie length, ratings, votes, revenue, and directorsâ€™ average ratings, with visualizations that reveal key trends across those years.

It was a rewarding project to sharpen my data analysis skills while diving into a decade of movie data. Feel free to explore the analysis and reach out if you have any questions.
